### Process Flows

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Client sends credentials
   - Server validates user
   - JWT tokens are generated and returned
   - Protected routes use token for authentication

2. **Video Upload Flow**:
   - Video and thumbnail files are uploaded to Cloudinary
   - Metadata is stored in MongoDB
   - Video is associated with the user

3. **Comment System Flow**:
   - Comments are linked to videos and users
   - Nested comments are supported through parent references
   - Comments can be liked, updated, or deleted

4. **Subscription Flow**:
   - Users can subscribe to other users' channels
   - Subscription status determines content visibility
   - Subscription counts are tracked for analytics
